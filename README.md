# IMDB Database
This project takes .csv files obtained from IMDB and creates a local database from them using 3 SQL scripts.
First, the schema script will create or reset tables with each file being an entity and the data being the attributes.
Secondly, the data script populates the data by loading it from the excel files. This will require running the script as admin or granting permissions to MySQL beforehand.
Finally, the query script performs 10 different queries that involve retrieving data based on the ratings of movies.
This project was my first project in my database design class to demonstrate my understanding of relational database design and SQL querying.
